<h2 id="section-4-processing-of-voice-recordings-and-data-by-artificial-intelligence">Section 4. Processing of Voice Recordings and Data by Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Controller applies a two-tier data processing model for artificial intelligence, ensuring the protection of raw User data:</p>
<p>Tier 1 — Processing of raw User data (voice recordings, transcriptions, vectors):
Voice recordings and transcriptions are processed exclusively within the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, on infrastructure located in the region corresponding to the User’s location (European Union or United States). Raw User data is not shared with other artificial intelligence service providers.</p>
<p>Tier 2 — Processing of derived data (summaries, classification, responses):
Processed and transformed data (such as note summaries, reformulated questions, search contexts) may be shared with external artificial intelligence service providers for the purpose of generating responses, classifying intent, and creating summaries. This data does not constitute a verbatim reproduction of the User’s utterances but rather a processed form thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voice recordings (audio) are transmitted from the User’s device to the Controller’s server solely for the purpose of obtaining a text transcription. The voice recording is then forwarded to the Azure OpenAI Service (Whisper model) for speech-to-text conversion. The voice recording resides in server memory only for the time necessary to complete the transcription and is then permanently deleted. The Controller does not store, archive, or copy voice recordings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transcription of a voice recording is processed by artificial intelligence models for the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>creation of numerical vectors (embeddings) enabling semantic search — Azure OpenAI Service, Embedding model (Tier 1),</li>
<li>classification of User intent (note or question) — LLM models available through the providers listed in Section 5 (Tier 2),</li>
<li>generation of note summaries — LLM models available through the providers listed in Section 5 (Tier 2),</li>
<li>generation of answers to User questions based on saved notes — LLM models available through the providers listed in Section 5 (Tier 2),</li>
<li>text-to-speech synthesis (reading responses aloud) — Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech services; speech synthesis is performed on text generated by the Controller’s system, not on raw User data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of the artificial intelligence service providers listed in Section 5 use User data for training, fine-tuning, or evaluating their models. The Controller exclusively uses API interfaces subject to Enterprise/API terms that guarantee customer data is not used in the model training process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the Azure OpenAI Service, data may be temporarily retained by Microsoft Corporation for up to 30 (thirty) days for abuse monitoring purposes, in accordance with the Azure service terms. The Controller endeavors to obtain an exemption from such monitoring (Modified Abuse Monitoring or Zero Data Retention) as such options become available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voice recordings are not processed for the purpose of biometric identification of the User. Voice is used solely as a medium for content to be converted to text (speech-to-text). The Controller does not create, store, or compare voiceprints or other biometric identifiers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5-recipients-of-personal-data">Section 5. Recipients of Personal Data</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Users’ personal data may be disclosed to the following categories of recipients:</p>
<ol>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The providers listed in subsection 1, items 2–4 process User data solely for the purpose of providing services to the Controller and do not use such data for training, fine-tuning, or improving their own artificial intelligence models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Controller does not sell Users’ personal data to third parties. Within the meaning of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the Controller does not engage in the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Controller does not disclose Users’ personal data to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Controller reserves the right to change the artificial intelligence service providers listed in subsection 1, items 2–4, provided that at least an equivalent level of personal data protection is maintained. The Controller shall inform Users of material changes to providers by updating this Privacy Policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-6-location-of-data-processing-and-transfers-of-data-outside-the-european-economic-area-eea">Section 6. Location of Data Processing and Transfers of Data Outside the European Economic Area (EEA)</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Controller applies the principle of regional data processing (data residency):</p>
<ol>
<li>data of Users accessing the Application within the European Economic Area is processed on servers located in the European Union,</li>
<li>data of Users accessing the Application outside the European Economic Area may be processed on servers located in the United States of America or in the European Union.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raw data of EEA Users (voice recordings and transcriptions) is processed exclusively on infrastructure located within the European Union (Azure OpenAI Service, EU region; Neon Inc., Frankfurt region).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Derived data (summaries, reformulated questions, search contexts) of EEA Users may be transferred to providers located in the United States of America, as listed in Section 5, subsection 1, item 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where data is transferred outside the EEA, the Controller ensures an adequate level of personal data protection through the application of at least one of the following mechanisms:</p>
<ol>
<li>an adequacy decision by the European Commission (including the EU-US Data Privacy Framework),</li>
<li>Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (SCC),</li>
<li>other legally permissible safeguards provided for in Chapter V of the GDPR.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>With respect to the database (Neon Inc.), the Controller applies encryption of data at rest and in transit. The database contains transcriptions, summaries, numerical vectors, and Account data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The User may obtain further information about the safeguards applied and a copy of the relevant documents by contacting the Controller at the address specified in Section 1, subsection 2.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-8-user-rights">Section 8. User Rights</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Users are entitled to the following rights in connection with the processing of their personal data:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Right of access (Article 15 GDPR):
The User has the right to obtain confirmation from the Controller as to whether their personal data is being processed, and if so, the right to access such data and information about the purposes of processing, categories of data, recipients, retention periods, and applicable rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right to rectification (Article 16 GDPR):
The User has the right to request prompt rectification of inaccurate personal data or completion of incomplete data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right to erasure — “right to be forgotten” (Article 17 GDPR):
The User has the right to request erasure of their personal data where the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, where the User has withdrawn consent (if processing was based on consent), where the User has lodged a successful objection, where the data was processed unlawfully, or where erasure is required by law. This right may be limited where processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right to restriction of processing (Article 18 GDPR):
The User has the right to request restriction of processing where the accuracy of data is contested, where processing is unlawful and the User opposes erasure, where the Controller no longer needs the data but it is required by the User for the establishment of claims, or where the User has lodged an objection to processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right to data portability (Article 20 GDPR):
The User has the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format (JSON) and the right to transmit that data to another controller. This right applies to data processed on the basis of consent or a contract, by automated means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right to object (Article 21 GDPR):
The User has the right at any time to object to the processing of personal data based on the Controller’s legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). The Controller shall cease processing unless it demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for processing that override the User’s interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right to withdraw consent:
To the extent that personal data processing is based on consent, the User has the right to withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out prior to its withdrawal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To exercise the above rights, the User should contact the Controller at the address specified in Section 1, subsection 2 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Controller shall respond to the User’s request without undue delay and no later than within 30 (thirty) days of receipt of the request. In particularly complex cases or where numerous requests are received, this period may be extended by an additional 60 (sixty) days, of which the Controller shall inform the User.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The User has the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority — the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (ul. Stawki 2, 00-193 Warsaw, Poland, <a href="http://www.uodo.gov.pl">www.uodo.gov.pl</a>) — if the User considers that the processing of their personal data infringes the GDPR.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-9-automated-decision-making-and-profiling">Section 9. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h2>
<ol>
<li>

<li>automatic generation of note summaries,</li>
<li>automatic semantic search within saved notes,</li>
<li>automatic generation of answers to User questions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The automated processing referred to in subsection 1 does not constitute automated decision-making within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>it does not produce legal effects concerning the User,</li>
<li>it does not similarly significantly affect the User,</li>
<li>it is an integral part of the Service that the User has requested.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event of an incorrect intent classification (e.g., a note classified as a question or vice versa), the User may delete the incorrectly created record and re-record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Controller does not profile Users for marketing, advertising purposes, or for the purpose of making decisions that affect access to the Service or its terms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-10-personal-data-security">Section 10. Personal Data Security</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Controller applies appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or disclosure, including in particular:</p>
